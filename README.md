# Portfolio
Personal portfolio made with HTML and css. It does not take any javascript, although some functionality can be added to it. That's up to everyone's taste.  The style that I have chosen to make this portfolio is known as "Bentos Style". The 'Apple' brand uses it a lot when presenting new products.
